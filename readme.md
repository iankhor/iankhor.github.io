##  AIM , THOUGHT PROCESS & INFLUENCE
My aim was to create a 'clean' and 'simple' one pager to quickly introduce myself to the reader.
My initial thought process was to start from a blank canvas and add elements to it.

When it comes to 'clean', i exploited white spaces as in a blank canvas and let the elements standout by using colour contrast for the elements I've put in.

To keep it 'simple', i have allowed no more than 5 different major colours in each section. The major colours were based on my lifestyle photos - White, blue, brown, black/grey. I believe the lesser colours there are, the more focus the audience would be onto the content after being visually stimulated by the simplicity of colours on a page.

In terms of contents, started with what I want in each section and added my personality to it. Depicting what is my purpose was, why did I do coding - to make a difference. I loved superhero movies and I added that theme to the headings and the contents. Like with every superhero movie the flow of the story goes like its origin story (who am i), their powers (my skills) , saving the world (my past projects) and their alter ego (my personality on the web).

Furthermore, heroes usually operate behind the scenes. Hence I've added the parallax effect to add the sense of suspense and depth.


## BUILD PROCESS
I had a initial sketch of what i want my website to be below:

I further gotten inspiration on the style of my website from several of the following images:

Initially I started with pure CSS to get an understanding of how HTML & CSS interacts. Noticing that if I would require to code my webpage responsive design and the timeline of 1 week to complete a webpage, I decided to use the Bootstrap CSS framework to rapid prototype the second iteration of my webpage.

Bootstrap certainly helped along the way and I was more focused of the finer details of the webpage for a more immersive experience for the reader.
