##  AIM , THOUGHT PROCESS & INFLUENCE
My aim was to create a 'clean' and 'simple' one pager to quickly introduce myself to the reader.
My initial thought process was to start from a blank canvas and add elements to it. When it comes to
'clean', i exploited white spaces as in a blank canvas and let the elements standout by using colour contrast in the elements i've put in. To keep it 'simple', i have allowed no more than 5 different major colours in each section. The major colours were based on my lifestyle photos - White, blue, brown, black/grey.  I believe the lesser colours there are, the more focus the audience would be onto the content after being visually stimulated by the simplicity of colours on a page.

In terms of contents, started with what i want in each section and added my flavour to it. Which is what is my purpose, why did I do coding, do make a difference. I loved superhero movies and I added that theme to the headings and the contents. Like with every superhero movie the flow of the story goes like its origin story(who am i), what superpower (my skills) , saving the world (my past projects) and their alter ego (their personality on the web).
